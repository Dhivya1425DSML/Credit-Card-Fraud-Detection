# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection

A data science project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. This notebook demonstrates data exploration, visualization, and model-building steps to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

## üìò Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge for financial institutions, causing billions in losses annually. The goal of this project is to analyze transactional data and build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on historical patterns.

The dataset includes features related to transaction amount, card type, merchant category, cardholder demographics, and fraud indicators.

The dataset used is available here: [credit_card_transactions.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchanaInsights/Datasets/refs/heads/main/credit_card_transactions.csv)

## üß© Key Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Imported dataset from GitHub using `pandas`
- Checked data types, missing values, and data distribution
- Separated categorical and numerical variables

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis:** Distribution of categorical and numerical features  
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Relationships between features and fraud labels  
- Visualized patterns using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

### 3. Feature Engineering *(optional if included in notebook)*
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized or scaled numerical features

### 4. Model Development *(if present in your notebook)*
- Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost)
- Evaluated performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualized confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve

### 5. Insights & Conclusion
- Identified key drivers of fraudulent transactions  
- Discussed business implications and prevention strategies
